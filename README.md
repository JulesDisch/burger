# burger
Here we have a full-stack site, utilizing a custom CSS, JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML on the client-side, as well as Express.js to create our server, MySQL and Node.js to query and route data in our application, a custom ORM to interact with our database, and Handlebars to generate our HTML. We have deployed the finished application with Heroku. 

The application is Eat da Burger! The user can type in a burger name of their choice under "Make a burger". Once they click "Make a burger", the burger will populate in the "Available burgers" column. The user can choose to "Devour!" or "Remove from menu!" these burgers. If devoured, they will appear in the "Devoured burgers!" column, where they can choose to "Make another!" and put them back in the "available column". If the user removes the burger, it will no longer be an option in either column.

The deployed version can be found at https://thawing-thicket-89116.herokuapp.com/.
